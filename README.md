# Social Network Api

## Project Summary

The Goal of this assignment is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. 

There was no starter code given and all the code is written for the back-end. Since there is no front-end code, all testing must be done with Insomnia or another similar application.
